                <p>I am in my 3rd year of my BSc in Plant Biology with a minor in French.

                <p>I am a third year Bioinformatics student learning computer programming while pursuing my passions in biology. One of the aspects of biology that fascinates me is the brain. It has the capacity to learn, understand and apply. Although today we are still unable to know how the whole brain functions, we have discovered many intresting properties of the brain. At the moment recreational drugs is one of the simplest concepts to learn yet very interesting. It is fascinating to know how the body reacts to these reagents and how we become addicted. In this club I will be ensuring the smooth operation of IT. I hope with this information we can educate teens, so they can make informed decisions.</p>

                <p>Hola, my name is Jose Uriel Perez Alvarez Gutierrez Anota, but you can call me Uriel. I’m a third year Biomedical Sciences student at the University of Calgary who is not only in love with science, but also dedicated to promoting healthy lifestyles. As VP External, I have the task of directly expanding the outreach of RED, using my business and personable skills. In addition to stimulating new ideas for the club, I facilitate the communication between schools, coordinating presentation dates, and target club objectives. Despite having to do the “grown up” duties in the club, my role as VP External exposes me to first hand teaching experiences with individuals passionate about biology and eager to lend their knowledge about the intricate workings of the human body. I’m eager to continue this experience and expand RED’s outreach.
