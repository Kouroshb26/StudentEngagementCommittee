                        RED has hit another home-run with two presentation days back-to-back at the McKenzie Highlands School! With exposure to a variety of neuroscience related topics, RED has definitely knocked these presentations out of the ballpark! We would once again like to thank our hard working volunteers who have taken time out from their well-deserved summer break and have contributed towards such a great educational experience! Hope you all have a relaxing summer and be sure to look forward to more presentations and events RED has planned in the near future!

First and foremost, RED would like to thank all of our presenters for their hard work and Georges P Vanier School for letting us be a part of such a great, educational experience! Thanks to G.P. Vanier's generosity, four of our volunteers each received a mug. We love the gifts and are definitely looking forward to collaborating in the future.

                        RED can add another presentation to it is done list! RED recently collaborated with LINKages this past weekend and had the opportunity to lead interactive activities aimed at informing seniors about several common drugs and their effects on one’s brain and behavior. Topics such as substance misuse and addiction were explored through interactions among participants and throughout the event. To start off the event, LINKages participants were first asked series of trivia questions regarding biological pathways and the role of neurons. In the latter half, participants learned about familiar drugs and found themselves engaged in an insightful discussion surrounding the legalization of marijuana to conclude the day! All in all, RED received a lot of positive feedback from the participants and hopes to collaborate with LINKages in the near future! A huge shout out to our hardworking RED club volunteers- we cannot thank you enough!

                        On February 23rd, RED had the privilege to deliver nine presentations to junior high school students in grades 7-9, attending Georges P. Vanier. It would not have been possible without our lovely RED club volunteers and we would like to thank each one of you for your continuous dedication and commitment! In terms of the in-class presentations, we were glad to hear about the heightened interest and engagement involving the activities planned and information conveyed by RED. Students were exposed to a variety of material from covering the role of the neurons in the brain to how different substances, such as alcohol, affect an individual’s behavior. Students also got the opportunity to take part in reaction time tests, engage in a debate surrounding a popular topic, and enjoyed diagnosing “patients” in our “Patient Overdose Investigation” activity. Overall, the presentations were an incredible experience and we look forward to the presentations planned in the near future!!

Several members of the club were able to prepare and present a total of five presentations to grade 8 and 9 classes at RT Alderman Middle school. The feedback we received was all positive and we are looking forward to going back next year with updated presentations. RED is constantly working on research and development to keep our presentations up to date and relevant.</p>

                        Thanks to the Neuroscience Student Association (NSA) for wanting to collaborate with us for the <i>"Adult Only Night"</i> at Telus Spark on November 10th! Although RED is mainly focused on educating the youth, we were able to expand our horizon and try to implement our activities with a bit of an older audience. With the support of the NSA, we hosted a fantastic event which participants seemed to really enjoy. Many learned new things, some tried to diagnose patients while others were too busy being competitive in our reaction-time test. All in all, it was a lot of fun informing the general public about the science of drugs! Stay tuned for more updates!

                        We had an amazing bake sale in which we raised roughly $200 that would be used to purchase materials for our presentations at our schools. Some of the money was also used to subsidize the cost of our new crewnecks for our members that are presenting. We want to personally thank anyone that contributed to the bake sale - especially Megan, with her awesome macarons!

We hope that with our hard work over the summer, we can deliver an amazing presentation in the coming weeks.
